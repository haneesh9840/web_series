        <p><span>plot::</span>The show is divided into three major plot lines. The first covers the battle between the lords of the continent of Westeros — most notably members of the Baratheon, Lannister, and Stark families — who are involved in the fight for the Iron Throne. The second follows the rise of Daenerys Targaryen, the last member of an exiled family as she builds an army in Essos to reclaim the throne. The third plot takes place in the North of Westeros among the Night's Watch, an armed unit that guards the 300-mile-long, 70-foot-tall wall that protects the rest of the continent from the mythical creatures that lurk there.</p>
        <p><span>My Review::</span>each and every web series has a drawback may be its a minor,or major but coming to got  though it has a minor,it is a true masterpiece with finest work that has ever produced till date.The main reason why got is such a hit is because of its story.Trust me it has a fantastic script work.Though disappointed a bit at the final season but the rest is really awesome.it was my second webseries that i watched,yet i placed it in the first place because of its uniqueness.The background score was ultimate one which was added to my playlist.yes,i still do listen it.it is such a gem.after completing season 7,i still remember it,i cried for a while realizing to the fact that i should wait for the next season to watch the next eposide.Seaosn 8 is the biggest thing that i have waited in my whole life.My favourite eposide is 3 from season 8.Coming to vfx,This is the best.My favourite character is Arya stark and daenerys ofcourse.The reason why everyone hated season 8 is because of its ending but coming to that point where it went wrong its like  a sad ending where people expected a happy ending so, they felt bad including me.But Its done and we should accept that.Hence i considered it as a minor one and placed it in the first place.If you love Drama,war,vfx give a Try and you will experience a new world for Sure.  </p>

        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4056407.jpg" class="image" height="2%" width="20%">
        <p><span>plot::</span>When two children go missing in a small German town, its sinful past is exposed along with the double lives and fractured relationships that exist among four families as they search for the kids. The mystery-drama series introduces an intricate puzzle filled with twists that includes a web of curious characters, all of whom have a connection to the town's troubled history -- whether they know it or not. The story includes supernatural elements that tie back to the same town in 1986. "Dark" represents the first German original series produced for Netflix.</p>
        <p><span>My Review::</span>Every human does mistakes and i did one.My friend suggested me this series 2 years back, but at then i didnt paid much attention to this series.In this quarantine another friend suggested me this series so I thought to give a Try.Basically im a huge fan of suspenses and twists.After watching this series,i felt guilty for not seeing it earlier.This series had hold my brain for few days.This is an mind-binding series.First few eposides were difficult to understand and later on each eposide revealed a twist and connection which connects with the earlier eposides.so this made me become a cult fan of this classic.It was around 3 am,i completed season 2,then there is ending twist which made me think 3 hours finding for the answer.That ending twist will really blow your mind.season 2 leaves you around 30 unanswered questions.At season 3 6 th eposide the number of unanswered questions will be raised to 60.But trust the next eposide answers all unanswered questions.Now you must have known why it is called mind-bending series.The season3 ending was a  perfect one.It woud be spoiler if i reveal much.My favourite character is Martha.The greatest plus point for this series is cast.finding someone with similar traits is difficult but they succedded in finding them.Time travelling is one of the toughest topics to explain,the director created the unanswered questions in our mind and let them go in one single eposide which is purely his brilliance. If you are fan of Time travelling concepts give a try,and make your mind to be twisted!!&#128521

        <p><span>My Review::</span>Basically,i hate chemistry.so i didnt wanted to watch this series.But, i thought to google it and then i found that this is highest rating(9.5) series that is ever made.so i decided to watch it.First two seasons were smooth.It will be in a slow move revealing the plot.from season 3 onwards the main story starts and you will start liking the series.Many of my friends had left at season 2,But I'm sure once they watch full series they will feel bad for leaving in between.season 4 and season5 will keep you on the edge of the seat.First 3 seasons i took around 10 days to complete and next 2 seasons i completed in 2.5 days.I still remember,where i completed 13 eposides in one day.I seriously admire the story,which has a perfect ending and brilliant twists.My favourite character is walter white and Jesse pinkman.WW is an intelligent character after sherlock.when he is surrounded with problems, he simply escapes from them.Finally i want to tell one thing,<br><h3 style="text-align: center">BREAKING BAD IS NOT ONE OF THE BEST SERIES,IT IS THE BEST SERIES</h3>

        <p><span>My Review::</span>Dont judge a book by its cover,but still you have to do it sometimes&#128514&#128514.watch this series at your own risks as each eposide contains atleast two "A" rated scenes.but coming to the story it is fantastic.i really enjoyed watching this series.If you love comedy then watch this series it will entertain you thoroughly throughout the season.My favourite character is eric and maeve.His comedy timing was unmatchable.Because of him,you can watch this series again and again without any heistation.season 2 one or two eposides were lag but it still entertains you.That's the beauty of this series.The last eposide ends with an unexpected twist and there is a character whom i cursed for atleast 10 days.Im sure you would do the same if you start watching this series.once,you started watching,you feel like connection with the characters.Waiting for season3.</p>

        <p><span>plot::</span> a mysterious man known as "The Professor" recruits a group of eight people, who choose cities for code-names, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the Royal Mint of Spain, and escaping with €2.4 billion. After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events succeeding the initial heist, the group are forced out of hiding, and find themselves preparing for a second heist, this time on the Bank of Spain, as they again deal with hostages and police forces.</p>
        <p><span>My Review::</span>I think most of you had already watched series.This is one of the brilliant series that is ever made.The first two seasons were awesome and each eposide ends with a incomplete feeling which makes audience curious about the next eposide.My favourite character is professor,his thinking power and plan executation strategy were out of the box.Actually the director just planned to complete in two series,but he never thought that this series will become such a big hit that is entertained all over the world.so he came up with season 3 in just 6 months preparation,i think that was not enough for this epic show, as people are left with high expectations on this show.season 3 and season 4 were quite disappointing but it is okay,good.i hope this will be covered in season 5. </p>

        <p><span>My Review::</span>Most of the sherlock fans might feel frustated for placing sherlock at 7 th position.But the thing is i already knew about the story before i could watch it.so i didnt felt much enthusiastic.But the story was such a gem.At first i saw 2 seasons and felt lag and left it.Then i came to know about the story and then i started watching again.My favourite character is "you know who".each eposide was around 1 hr 30 mins which i felt bore.sherlock was the most brilliant character.sometimes i feel amazed behind the logics that were revealed in the eposides.if you are fan of investigations,mysteries give a try to this classic and please, dont hear story from anyone.

    <p><span>Though the list was completed there is a series which cannot be placed in this criteria,i.e anime.hello hello,dont jump into conclusion that anime is only for kids,It is a age free series.The series which changed my opinion on anime is NARUTO.</span></p>
    <ul><li><h2>NARUTO</h2></li></ul>
    <img src="https://wallpaperplay.com/walls/full/8/b/4/239993.jpg" class="image" height="2%" width="20%">
        
    <p><span>plot::</span>Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tails attacked Konohagakure destroying much of the village and taking many lives. The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children — taking their cues from their parents — inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.</p>
    <p><span>My Review::</span>At beginning, i had a opinion that anime is only for kids.My friend challenged me to watch 10 eposides and you would definetly like it.So i accepted the challenge, I completed 10 eposides and thought to see the next 5 and I wanted to say that i didnt liked it.And i dont know what happened next i kept on postponing and started loving the series.Im unable to leave it.720 eposides i thought it would take years to complete(My friend took around 1 year) and i completed in 1 month.It would be silly if i call an anime character as my inspiration but it is true.Naruto is my inspiration,by watching this series i learnt many important lessons that no one teaches in real life.never give up is the greatest quality that one can possess in their life,that thing i learnt from naruto.you feel connection with the characters.I cried more than 6 times by watching this series.If you dont believe find someone who watched naruto without crying atleast once.It has the greatest background music that you ever heard.some scenes and some elevations just give you goosebumps.If you love twists,strategies,fights,love give a try,each and every element was designed in a brilliant way.My favourite character is "you know who" and hinata.If you ever feel depressed or want motivation in your life watch naruto you will be boosted enough for your entire life.Dont get scared of 720 eposides,each eposide is of 20 minutes and some of the eposides were filters which can be skipped.If you started watching naruto you will come to know slowly.I strongly believe that there can be no other series greater than naruto or equal to naruto.finally,everyone should watch this series atleast once, before they are dead.
